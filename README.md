## 🔧 Overview

**COD BO6 Visual ESP Assistant** is a toolkit designed for developers, UI designers, and engine researchers.  
It overlays real-time 2D bounding boxes around entities (players, bots), displays health and distance markers, and offers configurable visual assists — all without modifying game files or injecting into memory.  
Built as a passive overlay, it ensures the game remains untouched.
